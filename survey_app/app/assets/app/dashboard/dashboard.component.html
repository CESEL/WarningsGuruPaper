<h3>Warnings Study</h3>

We are presently doing a study on the introduction of static analysis warnings (Findbugs & Jlint) in the commits of projects
and their usefulness to software developers. In the process of this analysis we observed the new warnings on commits and are
trying to assess if they are useful to the developer who worked on the commit
